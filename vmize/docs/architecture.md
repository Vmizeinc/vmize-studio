High-level overview:

- `backend/` — Express.js API, MongoDB models, cron jobs, and server logic.
- `frontend/` — Static HTML/CSS/JS site used for marketing, demo, and admin UI.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI/CD workflows for building and deploying frontend and backend.

Add more architecture notes here as needed.
